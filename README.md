## Summary 
- This was an interesting project because I was forced to utilize the developer tools to figure how why things were spaced a certain way or why something was not appearing the way it was supposed to be
- I carried over my knowledge learned from project recipes and implemented flex-grow/shrink/basis, flex-direction, justify content & align-item/self
- I will be looking to improve the code by revisiting old concepts, so stay tuned!
